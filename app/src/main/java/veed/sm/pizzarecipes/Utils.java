            "step #1\n" +
            "In a deep bowl, pour 1 cup of lukewarm water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar and 10 g of dry yeast. Mix the contents of the bowl and leave for 10 minutes to make the yeast work.\n" +
            "step #2\n" +
            "sift 2.5 cups of flour through a sieve. Pour 3 tablespoons of olive oil and a solution of yeast into the flour.\n" +
            "Knead the dough. Of course, at first it is more convenient to do this with a spoon, and when the dough thickens enough, we continue to knead it with our hands (at least 5 minutes).\n" +
            "When the dough is kneaded, put it in a deep bowl, grease with olive oil and cover with a damp towel. We put the yeast dough in a warm place so that it fits, for one hour.\n" +
            "step #3\n" +
            "While the dough is suitable, prepare the pizza sauce. To do this, peel and finely chop 2 cloves of garlic. Pour vegetable oil into a preheated frying pan. Pour 400 ml of mashed tomatoes in their own juice into the pan. Immediately add salt, freshly ground pepper and garlic to the tomatoes. Mix all the ingredients and bring the sauce to a boil. We taste it. Sometimes it happens that mashed tomatoes come across with sourness, so you need to add sugar to the sauce to balance the taste. I will not give you any advice on how much sugar to add, but do it according to your taste.\n" +
            "It's time to give the sauce real Italian flavors! To do this, we send 1 teaspoon of oregano and 1 teaspoon of basil to the pan. Mix it up. Reduce the heat and bring the sauce to the desired consistency. This will take about 15 minutes.\n" +
            "step #4\n" +
            "In order not to waste time in vain, we prepare the cheese-grate it on a grater. In order to make the pizza as delicious as possible, I use two types of cheese. The first one is always the same, it's mozzarella for pizza. It is for pizza, not in brine. This is due to the fact that the taste of cheese is more pronounced in it, so I like it more in pizza. The second cheese is recommended to add the one that you like best. In my case, it's gouda.\n" +
            "step #5\n" +
            "We have come to the most important ingredient of pepperoni pizza-this is pepperoni sausage. You can not find it everywhere, but without it, this pizza will not work, so you need to do it!\n" +
            "Cut the sausage into thin slices.\n" +
            "step #6\n" +
            "By this time, the dough should have risen. We remove it from the bowl and divide it into 3 parts (the ingredients given in this recipe are enough for 3 small pizzas).\n" +
            "Roll out each part of the dough into a pizza base. Cut the dough into a baking dish-the pizza base will get a regular round shape and the pizza will look much more attractive.\n" +
            "step #7\n" +
            "Preheat the oven to the maximum temperature. In my case, it's 280 degrees.\n" +
            "Let's start assembling the pizza. We dust the baking dish with flour so that the dough does not stick to it. Spread the pizza base, lubricate the prepared sauce and distribute it evenly, while 1.5 cm to the edge of the base should not be covered with sauce. Sprinkle the sauce with a mixture of grated cheeses. Spread the pepperoni slices.\n" +
            "step #8\n" +
            "We put the pizza in the oven. At 280 degrees, the pepperoni pizza will bake in my oven for about 6 minutes.\n" +
            "When the pizza is ready, I highly recommend pouring a little olive oil on top of it and sprinkling with oregano.\n" +
            "step #9\n" +
            "Homemade pepperoni pizza is completely ready.\n" +
